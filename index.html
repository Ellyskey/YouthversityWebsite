            <h2>Why YOUthversity</h2>
            <p>The name of the community is the result of a long research work, we wanted a name that could best represent us and in the end, Youthversity was the favorite.</p>
            <p>Inside our name, there are four keywords:</p>
            <p><strong>YOU</strong>: because we think that everyone is unique and fundamental. The single person with his individual ideas, inserted in a group, is a gear that makes the machine move better.</p>
            <p><strong>Youth</strong>: to be understood as mental youth and not anagraphic. It means freshness of ideas, a desire to do and get involved, for themselves and for others.</p>
            <p><strong>Diversity</strong>: being a worldwide community means having different people. Diversity, like the uniqueness of everyone, is a fundamental value for us when it establishes a dialogue and does not discriminate.</p>
            <p><strong>University</strong>: we are born as an online study community. The university is that path of study that you usually start with free choice and that does not consist only in theoretical study but makes you grow as a person. This is what we want to represent.</p>
