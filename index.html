            <h2>What we do</h2>
            <p>We focus on getting things done without burning out. Our community uses Twitch and Discord to host:</p>
            <p><strong>Focus Sessions</strong>: Using the Pomodoro technique to help everyone stay on track with work or studies.</p>
            <p><strong>Wellness Breaks</strong>: Weekly meditations and workouts to keep the mind and body healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Social Hobbies</strong>: Groups for reading, languages, and crafts to help members unwind.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: We provide a structured yet flexible environment where members can share resources, participate in skill-building workshops, and engage in collaborative projects that turn personal goals into shared achievements.</p>

            <p>Our mission is to provide a supportive environment where productivity meets wellness.</p>
            <p>We do this to ensure that while our members reach their professional or academic milestones, they also maintain their mental health and build meaningful connections with a diverse, global family.</p>

            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>It all started in January 2021. Elly, our founder, was stuck at home during the second COVID lockdown and really struggling to keep up with her studies. Looking for a way to stay on track, she started "studywithme" streams on Twitch. <br>She quickly realized she wasn't alone —plenty of other people were going through the exact same thing.
            <p>What began as a way to get through a tough time turned into something much bigger. The community just kept growing from there. <br>Today, YOUthversity has a full management team working alongside Elly to keep the spark alive and make sure everyone has a supportive place to grow.</p>

            <h2>Why YOUthversity</h2>
            <p>The name of the community is the result of a long research work, we wanted a name that could best represent us and in the end, Youthversity was the favorite.</p>
            <p>Inside our name, there are four keywords:</p>
            <p><strong>YOU</strong>: because we think that everyone is unique and fundamental. The single person with his individual ideas, inserted in a group, is a gear that makes the machine move better.</p>
            <p><strong>Youth</strong>: to be understood as mental youth and not anagraphic. It means freshness of ideas, a desire to do and get involved, for themselves and for others.</p>
            <p><strong>Diversity</strong>: being a worldwide community means having different people. Diversity, like the uniqueness of everyone, is a fundamental value for us when it establishes a dialogue and does not discriminate.</p>
            <p><strong>University</strong>: we are born as an online study community. The university is that path of study that you usually start with free choice and that does not consist only in theoretical study but makes you grow as a person. This is what we want to represent.</p>
