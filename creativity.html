                     <p>Get ready for a cozy burst of creativity! During Crafternoon, we come together to work on our favorite creative projects — whether that’s crocheting, painting, drawing, journaling, or any other craft that brings you joy. It’s a relaxed space to create, share, and enjoy the company of others while letting your imagination flow. <br> <br> Cameras and microphones are completely optional — join however you feel most comfortable. <br> <br> We meet every other Wednesday and Sunday, alternating each week. So grab your yarn, brushes, or sketchbook, and spend a calm and creative evening with us!</p>

                     <p>Our Puzzling Nights are all about teamwork, focus, and fun! We gather in a cozy Discord voice channel to solve jigsaw puzzles together using <a href="http://tanggle.io"><strong>Tanggle</strong></a>, an online platform perfect for collaborative puzzling sessions. <br> <br> Thanks to Tanggle’s generosity, our community enjoys access to the higher Pro tier — #GIFTED by the platform itself! That means more puzzles, more features, and even more opportunities to connect while we piece things together.<br> <br> Join us, chat while puzzling, or simply relax and enjoy the shared sense of accomplishment as each image comes to life, one piece at a time.</p>
