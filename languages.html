                    Youthversity has been a home to many avid language learners! What better way to enhance our enthusiasm for language learning than to do something fun, and accountable, together!

                     <h2 style="text-align: center;">Community Language Board</h2>
                     <p>At the start of every month, everyone is invited to share their monthly goals and they will be posted on a personally tailored visual board, which will be updated from time to time. <br> <br> We recognise that people have different target languages and are working on different levels. These boards are about accountability and motivation - so it doesn’t matter if you’re an advanced or casual learner! <br> <br> There will even be an end of the month review to see how much we as a community were able to achieve for the month and what languages we practised!</p>

                     <h2 style="text-align: center;">Read-alongs</h2>
                     <p>A great way to practise a language is to read aloud! In collaboration with the bookclub, the community would gather to read our favourite stories and delve into the flavourful language of literature.  <br> <br> Join us as we dive into a Shakespearean classic, or perhaps grab a blanket as we snuggle into another gorgeous fairy tale or harrowing Edgar Allan Poe. The possibilities for the next read-along are endless!</p>
