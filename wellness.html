                    At YOUthversity, wellness is about more than self-care — it’s about nurturing balance, mindfulness, and connection together. <br> From cozy self-care nights to uplifting community challenges, we create spaces where taking care of yourself feels supportive, intentional, and fun. No matter how you choose to unwind, you’ll always find encouragement and good company along the way.

                     <h3>Meditation</h3>
                     <p>Every Monday morning, we come together to do a nice 10-minute meditation to start off our week! Whether you want to work on feelings of stress, frustration, energy levels or just to give yourself some positive affirmations — it is a great time to reflect on yourself and to look assuredly on the week ahead!</p>

                     <p>Sometimes life gets in the way and we can’t stay as active as we would like, but we can help each other out! Every Sunday morning, we gather to do some wellness activity together. <br> <br> There is no fixed itinerary of activities, you can do whatever you wish! So get your yoga mat, meditation candles, dumbbells, treadmill and cardio game remote. Let’s end our week strong with some exercise!</p>

                     <h3>Selfcare night</h3>
                     <p>Join us for a cozy evening dedicated to slowing down and taking care of yourself. Every <strong>4th Monday of the month</strong>, our community gathers for a gentle reminder to rest, recharge, and reconnect with what brings us joy. <br> <br> Whether it’s skincare with scrubs and face masks, painting your nails, brewing tea and reading a good book, journaling for the upcoming month, drawing tarot or oracle cards, or simply meditating to your favorite song, this time is yours. <br> <br> Put away other social media for a couple of hours, breathe deeply, and give yourself permission to unwind — you deserve it.</p>

                     <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Our self-care challenges turn everyday well-being into a playful adventure. Each challenge invites you to explore new habits, reflect on your routines, and prioritize yourself — all while having fun and sharing the journey with the community.<br> <br> Through peer-to-peer support, we lift each other up and celebrate every small victory together. Whether it’s journaling, stretching, resting, or simply drinking enough water, every action counts — because taking care of yourself should feel rewarding, not like a chore.</p>
